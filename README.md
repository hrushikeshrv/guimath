GUIMath is a widget style application meant to give users a graphical interface for creating equations 
to use on the web. It uses MathJax as a core dependency and as an external renderer to show users a preview 
of their equation as they are building it.  

It then generates LaTeX for the entered equation for you to handle however you want.
